When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop
this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the -c
option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of
object files output by the assembler.

Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.
Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler
itself.  Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most
of these are not documented here, since you rarely need to use
any of them.
